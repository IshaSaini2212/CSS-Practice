            On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the 
            overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers,
             footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures,
              charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can easily 
              change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the 
              selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format text
               directly by using the other controls on the Home tab.
