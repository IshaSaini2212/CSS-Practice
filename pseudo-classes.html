    <p>on the InseOrt tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the 
        overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers,
         footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures,
          charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can easily 
          change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the 
          selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format text
           directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. </p>
